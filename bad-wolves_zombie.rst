Bad Wolves - Zombie
===================

::

	[Intro]
	Dm Bb F C

	[Verse: Dm Bb F C]
	Another head hangs lowly
	Child is slowly taken
	And the violence causes silence
	Who are we mistaken?

	[Pre-Chorus: Dm Bb F C]
	But you see, it's not me
	It's not my family
	In your head, in your head, they are fighting
	With their tanks, and their bombs
	And their bombs, and their drones
	In your head, in your head, they are crying

	[Chorus: Dm Bb F C]
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

	[Verse: Dm Bb F C]
	Another mother's breaking
	Heart is taking over
	When the violence causes silence
	We must be mistaken

	[Pre-Chorus]
	It's the same old theme
	In two thousand eighteen
	In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
	With their tanks, and their bombs
	And their guns, and their drones
	In your head, in your head, they are dying

	[Chorus]
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

	[Bridge]
	It's the same old theme
	In two thousand eighteen
	In your head, in your head, they are dying

	[Chorus]
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	What's in your head, in your head?
	Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey oh
