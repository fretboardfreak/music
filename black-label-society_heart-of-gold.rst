Black Label Society - Heart of Gold
===================================

::

    I want live
    I want give
    I've been a miner for a heart of gold
    It's these reflections I never give
    That keep me searching for a Heart Of Gold
    And I'm getting old
    Keeps me searching for a Heart Of Gold
    And I'm getting old

    I've been to Hollywood
    I've been to Redwood
    I crossed and ocean for a Heart Of Gold
    I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
    That keeps me searching for a Heart Of Gold
    And I'm getting old
    Keeps Me Searching For A Heart Of Gold
    And I'm Getting Old

    Keep me searching for a Heart Of Gold
    And I'm getting old
