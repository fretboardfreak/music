    { Verse: D5  D5/C#  C  C/B }
    I can't get to sleep, I think about the implications
    of diving in too deep, and possibly the complications
    especially at night, I worry over situations
    I know I'll be alright, perhaps it's just imagination

    { B5  Asus4  A }
    Day after day it reappears
    { B5  Asus4  A }
    Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
    { F#sus4  F#  G  Asus4  A }
    Ghosts appear and fade away    [come back another day]

    { Verse: D5  D5/C#  C  C/B }
    Alone between the sheets, only brings exasperation
    It's time to walk the streets, smell the desperation
    At least there's pretty lights, and thoguh there's little variation
    it nullifies the night, from overkill

    { Chorus }

    { Repeat Verse 1 }

    { Chorus }

    { repeat "Ghosts appear and fade away" and fade away }
