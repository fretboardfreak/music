    {Verse: G  Em  D  DaddG  Cadd9/G}
    You're in your own world, it seems so nice
    You've left me here, sitting on ice
    It's chilly now in the cold
    Come on baby bring me home

    {Chorus: C  DaddG  Gmaj}
    Now how could that be (I don't know) You're without me    {:|}

    {Verse}
    I see the road clearly now
    It's rough but I'm slowing down
    Every step I take I think of you
    You've been mean but you pulled me through

    {Bridge}
    {C        G   D              Em}
    Life has come and swallowed me
    {C  G      D       Em}
    I'm running to get free
    {C         DaddG    A7  A7sus4  AaddG}
    I can't do it alone I need your help
    {C  G      D       G}
    Be a pal come get me out

    {G  Em  D  DaddG  Cadd9/G  :|}

    {Verse}
    I'm on the road to recovery
    I have to thank you. You sure helped me
    Stand by me now it's a test of faith
    you maid me realize, we're not safe
    you maid me realize, we're not safe

    {G  Em  D  DaddG  Cadd9/G  :|}
