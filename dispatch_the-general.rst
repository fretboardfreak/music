::

    There was a decorated general with a heart of gold,
    that likened him to all the stories he told
    of past battles won and lost, and legends of old
    a seasoned veteran in his own time

    On the battlefield he gained respectful fame
    with many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
    he grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
    and always urged his men on

    but on the eve of great battle with the infantry in dream
    the old general tossed in his sleep and wresled with its meaning
    he awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
    and walked slowly out of his tent

    All the men held tall with their chests in the air
    with courage in their blood and fire in their stare
    it was a gray morning and they were all wondering how they would fare
    till the old general told them to go home

        { refrain }
        he said: I have seen the others, and I have discovered
        that this fight is not worth fighting
        And I've seen their mothers, and I will no other
        to follow me where I'm going, So

        Take a shower and shine your shoes You got no time to lose
        you are young men you must be living  { x2 }
        go now you are forgiven

    But the men stood fast with their guns ontheir shoulders
    not knowing what to do with the contradicting orders
    the general said he would do his own duty but he would extend it no further
    the men could go as they please

    Not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
    until one by one they stepped back and not a word was said
    the general was left with his own words echoing in his head
    he then prepared to fight

        { refrain }
