Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams
=========================

::

    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree?
    I travel the world and the seven seas
    Everybody's looking for something

    Some of them want to use you
    Some of them want to get used by you
    Some of them want to abuse you
    Some of them want to be abused

    (synth breakdown with vocal heys)

    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree?
    I travel the world and the seven seas
    Everybody's looking for something

    (synth breakdown with high vocals)

    Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
    Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up

    (synth solo)

    Some of them want to use you
    Some of them want to get used by you
    Some of them want to abuse you
    Some of them want to be abused

    (synth breakdown, starting chord is F this time)

    Sweet dreams are made of this
    Who am I to disagree?

    Everybody's looking for something
