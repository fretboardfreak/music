::

    Life's ambitions occupy my time, Priorities come to the mind
    Happiness one step behind, This inner peace I've yet to find

    { Chorus }
    Rivers flow into the sea, but even the sea's not so full of me
    If I'm not blind why can't I see,
    that a circle can't fit where a square should be
    There's a hole in my heart that can only be filled by you
    And this hole in my heart can't be filled with the things I do

    Hole hearted, Hole hearted

    This heart of stone is where I hide, These feet of clay kept warm inside
    Day by day less satisfied, Not fade away before I die

    { Chorus }

    There's a hole in my heart that can only be filled by you
    Should have known from the start I'd fall short with the things I do

    Hole Hearted
