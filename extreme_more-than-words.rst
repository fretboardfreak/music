| G   G/B  C9          Am7             C       D         G
| saying I love you is not the words I want to hear from you
|     G/B         C9       Am7             C      D    Em
| it's not that I want you not to say, but if you only knew
|      Am7 D              G       D/F#    Em
| how easy it would be to show me how you feel
| Em/B        Am7     D2              G7     G7/B   C
| more than words, is all you have to do to make it real
|
| *PreChorus*

| then you wouldn't have to say that you love me,
|       Am7    D7   G
| cause I'd already know
|

| more than words to show you feel
|           D              G
| that your love for me is real
| G/B            D/F#      Em         Bm7   C
| what would you say, if I took those words away
|                               Am7         D7            G
| then you couldn't make things new just by saying I love you
| G/B C9               Am7               C   D            G

| G/B     C9            Am7                 C         D        Em
| all you have to do is close your eyes and just hold out your hands
|     Am7       D                    G    D/F#   Em
| and touch me, hold me close, don't ever let me go

| more than words is all I ever needed you to show

Chord Progression Rhythm Breakdown
==================================

.. note:: There are some bars where the chords start an eigth note early, but
          I've only illustrated that for a few bars in the verse.  As you can
          see it makes it much harder to see what's going on when it's all
          written out like that.
