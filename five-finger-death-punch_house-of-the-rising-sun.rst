Five Finger Death Punch - House of the Rising Sun
=================================================

::

    {Whistle Intro}
    {clean chords x1}

    {clean verse}
    There is a house in Sin City
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God, I know I'm one

    {distorted verse}
    My mother was a tailor
    She sewed my new blue jeans
    My father was a gamblin' man
    Down in Sin City

    {solo 1}

    {clean verse}
    Now the only thing a gambler needs
    Is a suitcase and a trunk
    And the only time he's satisfied
    Is when he's on a drunk

    {distorted verse}
    Well, I've got one foot on the platform
    The other's on the train
    I'm goin' back to Sin City
    To wear that ball and chain

    {breakdown chugging to solo 2}

    {distorted verse}
    Well, mothers, tell your children
    Never do what I have done
    Spend your lives in sin and misery
    In the house of the rising sun

    In the house of the rising sun  {repeat B and E}

    {clean verse}
    Well, there is a house in Sin City
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God knows that I, am one
