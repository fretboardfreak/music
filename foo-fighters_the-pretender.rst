    Keep you in the dark, You know they all pretend
    Keep you in the dark And so it all began

    Send in your skeletons
    Sing as their bones go marching in again
    They need you buried deep
    The secrets that you keep are ever ready
    Are you ready?

    I'm finished making sense Done pleading ignorance
    That whole defense

    Spinning infinity Boy, the wheel is spinning me
    It's never ending, never ending, Same old story

    {Chorus x2}
    What if I say I'm not like the others?
    What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
    You're the pretender
    What if I say that I will never surrender?

    In time or so I'm told
    I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
    The page is out of print, we are not permanent
    We're temporary, temporary
    Same old story

    {Chorus x2}

    I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear
    I'm the face that you have to face, mirrorin' your stare
    I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
    I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees
    So who are you? Yeah, who are you?
    Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you?

    Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend

    {Chorus x4}

    So who are you? Yeah, who are you?
    Yeah, who are you?
