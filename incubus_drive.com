| {Verse: |Emadd3  D  Cadd9  A :| }
| Sometimes, I feel the fear of
|   uncertainty stinging clear
| And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll
|   let the fear take the wheel and steer
|
| {Pre-Chorus: |C  A7  Cadd9  A :| }
| It's driven me before,
|   and it seems to have a vague,
|   haunting mass appeal
| But lately I am,
|   beginning to find that I,
|   should be the one behind the wheel
|
| {Chorus: |Emadd3  D  Cadd9  A :| }
| Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there,
|   with open arms and open eyes
| Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there,
|   I'll be there
|
| {Verse: |Emadd3  D  Cadd9  A :| }
| So if I decide to waiver my
|   chance to be one of the hive
| Will I choose water over wine and
|   hold my own and drive
|
| {Pre-Chorus: |C  A7  Cadd9  A :| }
| It's driven me before,
|   and it seems to be the way
|   that every one else gets around
| but lately I'm
|   beginning to find that
|   when I drive my self my light is found
|
| {Chorus}
|
| (C)Would you (A7)choose water over
| (C9)wine... (A)hold the wheel and drive
|
| {Chorus}
