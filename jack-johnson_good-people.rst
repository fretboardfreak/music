    You win, Its your show now so what's it gonna be
    Cause people will tune in how many train wrecks do we need to see
    Before we lose touch of, we thoguht this was low
    It's bad, getting worse so,

        { Chorus }
        Where'd all the good people go
        I've been changin channels, I don't see them on the TV shows
        Where'd all the good people go
        We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

    { Catch Verse }
    They got this and that and with a rattle a tat
    Testing, one, two, now whatcha gonna do
    bad news, misused, got too much to lose
    gimme some truth, now who's side are we on

    whatever you say, turn on the boob tube
    I'm in the mood to obey, so lead me astray, by the way now

        { Chorus }

    Sitting round feeling far away, So far away but I can feel the debris
    [can you feel it] You interrupt me from a friendly conversation,
    to tell me how great it's all gonna be
    You might notice some hesitation,
    cause what's important to you is not important to me
    Way down be the edge of your reasons,
    it's beginning to show, And all I wanna know is

        { Chorus }

    { Catch Verse }

    whatever you say, run the resolute but in the mood to obay,
    station to station, desensitizing the nation
