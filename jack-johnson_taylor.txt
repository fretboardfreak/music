Jack Johnson - Taylor
=====================

| {Verse: (palm muted)  C   G/B   Am   F }
| they say Taylor was a good girl, never one to be late
| complain express ideas in her brain
|
| Working on the night shift, passing out the tickets
| You're going to have to pay her if you want to park here
|
| Well Mommy's little dancer's quite a little secret
| working on the streets now, never going to keep it
|
| It's quite an imposition and now she's only wishin'
| that she would have listened, to the words they said
|
| {Chorus}
| Poor Taylor
| She just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds air
| and she'll pretend that she's somewhere else
| so far and clear, about 2000 miles from here
|
| {Verse: (palm muted)  C   G/B   Am   F }
| peter patrick pitter patters on the window
| and sunny's silhouette won't let him in
| and poor old pete's got nothin cuz he's been fallin
| but somehow sunny knows just where he's been
| he thinks that singing on sunday's gonna save his soul
| now that Saturday's gone
| and sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
| but I can see that his brakelights are on
|
| {Chorus: (strumming)  C   G/B   Am   F }
| He just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds air
| and he'll pretend that he's somewhere else
| so far and clear about 2000 miles from here
|
| {Verse: (palm muted)  C   G/B   Am   F }
| Such a tough enchalada filled up with nada
| Giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
| used to be a limber chiken time has been a ticking
| now she's finger licking to the man
| with the money in his pocket, flying in his rocket
| only stopping by on his way to a better world
|
| {Outro}
| If Taylor finds a better world
| Then Taylor's going to run away
