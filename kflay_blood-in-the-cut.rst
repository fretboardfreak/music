Kflay - Blood in the Cut
========================

::

    {intro: riff x4}

    The boy I love's got another girl
    He might be fucking her right now
    I don't have an apartment
    Thought if I was smart I'd make it far
    But I'm still at the start

    Guess I'm contagious it'd be safest if you ran
    Fuck that's what they all just end up doing in the end
    Take my car and paint it black
    Take my arm, break it in half
    Say something, do it soon
    It's too quiet in this room

    {chorus}
    I need noise
    I need the buzz of a sub
    Need the crack of a whip
    Need some blood in the cut
    I need noise
    I need the buzz of a sub
    Need the crack of a whip
    Need some blood in the cut
    I need blood in the cut  {chug E}
    I need blood in the cut  {chug E}

    {hook riff distorted x2}

    Met back up with the boy I love
    Cried on the streets of San Francisco
    I don't have an agenda
    All I do is pretend to be OK so my friends
    Can't see my heart in the blender
    Lately, I've been killing all my time
    Reading through your messages my favorite way to die
    Take my head and kick it in
    Break some bread for all my sins
    Say a word, do it soon
    It's too quiet in this room

    {chorus}

    {hook riff distorted x2}

    {bridge: G A E E x2}
    (high register, Ahhhhh  (vocal B A G E)}

    {3 bars percussive build}
                                Cut!

    {na na na's (repeat the melody 4 times)}

    {chorus}
