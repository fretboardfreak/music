    {Verse: | Am | Am/F# | Am | F# \ |
            | Am | Am/F# | Am E | Am E :| }
    Bad news over my shoulder,
      don't dare look around
    I can swear I smell the brimstone,
      Believe I hear the hound

    {Chorus: | Am/F# | Am | Am/F# | Am |
             | Am  Am/F# | Am/F  E | Am E | Am E :| }
    No need in talkin it over,
      there's really nothing to say (hey)
    losing my race with the reaper,
      and there's gonna be the devil to pay

    {Verse}
    Well I tried a little store bought religion
      I just couldn't buy it could you
    All that birthin by virgins and denyin' one's urgins
      Somehow it just never rang true

    {Chorus}
    I do believe in evil,
      It's the one thing I'm sure is true
    and it's the hurt in our heart keeping us so apart,
      is the devil in me and you

    {Solo}
    {Verse}
    Now if you see me down in a tavern,
      wrecked and dirty, trashy and low
    It's true what they say, we've all got to pay
      and it's best to pay the devil you know

    {Chorus (repeat first chorus)}
    {Solo out}
