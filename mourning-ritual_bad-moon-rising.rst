Mourning Ritual - Bad Moon Rising
=================================

::

    {piano alone: Bm G Em}
    I see a bad moon rising
    I see trouble on the way
    I see earthquakes and lightning
    I see bad times today

    (0:40)
    {single strum power chords: G A B A G F# lowB}
    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    {fake drop}

    {rhythmic strumming}
    I see a bad moon rising
    I see trouble on the way
    I see earthquakes and lightning  (double speed strumming)
    I see bad times today

    (long strums with rhythmic addons)
    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    (just the bass notes with blasts on the E)
    I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
    I know the end is comin' soon
    I feel rivers overflowin'
    I hear the voice of rage and ruin

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise
