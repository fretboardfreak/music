Mourning Ritual - Bad Moon Rising
=================================

::

    I see a bad moon rising
    I see trouble on the way
    I see earthquakes and lightning
    I see bad times today

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    I see a bad moon rising
    I see trouble on the way
    I see earthquakes and lightning
    I see bad times today

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
    I know the end is comin' soon
    I feel rivers overflowin'
    I hear the voice of rage and ruin

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise

    Don't go around tonight
    Well, it's bound to take your life
    There's a bad moon on the rise
