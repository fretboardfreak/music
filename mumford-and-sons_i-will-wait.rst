*capo on 1st fret* ::

    {Intro | Am  | Em7  | C  F  | C  G  :| x2 }
    {Verse}
    C                    F
    I came home like a stone
                 C              Gadd4
    And I fell heavy into your arms
              C                   F
    These days of dust which we've known
              C                  Gadd4
    Will blow away with this new sun

    {Pre-Chorus }
         Am    Em7     C  F   C   G
    And I'll kneel down wait for now
    And I'll kneel down know my ground

    {Chorus}
     C                             Em   G
    I will wait, I will wait for you!
    And I will wait, I will wait for you!

    {C x4 }
    C                      F
    So break my step and relent
          C                    Gadd4
    You forgave and I won't forget
                    C                 F
    Know what we've seen and him with less
                C                 Gadd4
    Now in some way, shake the excess

     C                                Em     G   x4
    Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!

     C                           F
    Now I'll be bold as well as strong
            C                           Gadd4         G
    Use my head alongside my heart
               C                F
    So take my flesh and fix my eyes
                  C                           Gadd4           G
    That tethered mind free from the lies

       Am    Em7     C    F   C   G
    And I'll kneel down wait for now
    And I'll kneel down know my ground
    {C     Em7  Am      F   C   G     x2}
     C    Em7  Am   F          C       G
    Raise my hands paint my spirit gold
    And bow my head  Keep my heart slow
     C                                Em     G   x4   **end on C**
    Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!
