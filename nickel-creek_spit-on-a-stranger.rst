    { Verse: G /  Bm /  Em /  C  D }
    However you feel, whatever it takes
    Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
    Whatever you need, however so slight
    Whenever it's real, whenever it's right
    { Em  Em7/D#  Em7/D  Em/C# }
    I've been thinking long and hard about the things you said to me,
    { C  G }
    Like a bitter stranger
    { Em  Em7/D#  Em7/D  Em/C# }
    Now I see the long and short, the middle and what's in between

    { Chorus:  C  G  A7  C }
    I could spit on a stranger    [pull me out]
    You're a bitter stranger      [pull me out]

    { Verse: G /  Bm /  Em /  C  D }
    Whatever you feel, whatever it takes
    Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
    Whatever you need, however so slight
    { Em  Em7/D#  Em7/D  Em/C# }
    Honey, I'm a prize and you're a catch and we're a perfect match
    { C  G }
    Like two bitter strangers
    { Em  Em7/D#  Em7/D  Em/C# }
    Now I see the long and short, and I can make it last

    { Chorus x3 }

    { C  G  A7  C }
    See the sunshine in your eyes
    Try the things you never tried
    I'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high
