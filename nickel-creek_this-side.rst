    { E  C#m  A  B }

    { E  C#m  A  B }
    One day you'll see her and you'll know what I mean.
    { E  C#m  A  B  Cdim }
    Take her or leave her she will still be the same.
    { C#m  G#  A  B }
    She'll not try to buy you with her time.
    { E  C#m  A  B }
    But nothing's the same as you will see when she's gone

    { A  B  C#m  F#m  A }
    It's foreign on this side, and I"ll not leave my home again
    { B  C#m  Bbdim  A }
    There's no place to hide and I'm nothing but scared

    { E  C#m  A  B }
    You dream of colors that have never been made
    { E  C#m  A  B  Cdim }
    You imagine songs that have never been played
    { C#m  G#  A  B }
    They will try to buy you and your mind
    { E  C#m  A  B }
    Only the curious have something to find

    { A  B  C#m  F#m  A }
    It's foreign on this side and the truth is a bitter friend
    { B  C#m  Bbdim  A }
    but reasons few have I, to go back again

    { E  C#m  A  B }
    Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day
    { E  C#m  A  B  Cdim }
    Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain
    { C#m  G#  A  B }
    There's no path to follow once you're here
    { E  C#m  A  B }
    You'll climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs

    { A  B  C#m  F#m  A }
    It's foreign on this side, but it feels like I'm home again
    { B  C#m  Bbdim  A }
    There's no place to hide but I don't think I'm scared
    { A  B  Cdim  C#m- }
    There's no place to hide but I don't think I'm scared
    { -C#m  Bbdim  A  B  E }
    There's no place to hide but I don't think I'm scared

    { E  C#m  A  B }
