    If my situation gets out of control
    I could run down to Mexico
    If I need a place to do some layin' low
    I could run down to Mexico

    Sun is always in the sky
    Bands are always hoppin'
    You can shake it all you want
    Never feel like stoppin'
    Think I'll give my mind a rest and save my soul
    I will run down to Mexico

    If you don't have anywhere left to go
    You could run down to Mexico
    If you found the answer but still you don't know
    You could run down to Mexico

    You don't need to buy your friends
    They're just glad to meet ya
    Maybe even meet yourself
    A friendly senorita
    If you never try it you will never know
    You could run down to Mexico

    Taking a vacation from the freezing cold
    Gonna run down to Mexico
    Should have left a long, long time ago
    Gonna run down to Mexico

    Sun is always in the sky
    Bands are always hoppin'
    You can shake it all you want
    'Til you feel like stoppin'
    If you never try it you will never know
    You could run down to Mexico
