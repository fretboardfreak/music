    Warm yourself by the fire, son,
    And the morning will come soon.
    I'll tell you stories of a better time,
    In a place that we once knew.

    Before we packed our bags
    And left all this behind us in the dust,
    We had a place that we could call home,
    And a life no one could touch.

    {Chorus x2}
    Don't hold me up now,
    I can stand my own ground,
    I don't need your help now,
    You will let me down, down, down!

    Down!

    We are the angry and the desperate,
    The hungry, and the cold,
    We are the ones who kept quiet,
    And always did what we were told.

    But we've been sweating while you slept so calm,
    In the safety of your home.
    We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
    Everything you've known.

    {Chorus x2}

    So open your eyes child,
    Let's be on our way.
    Broken windows and ashes
    Are guiding the way.

    Keep quiet no longer,
    We'll sing through the day,
    Of the lives that we've lost,
    And the lives we've reclaimed.

    Go!

    {Chorus x2}

    Don't hold me up...
    (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
    Don't hold me up...
    (I don't need your help)
    No! No! No!
    Don't hold me up!
    (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
    Don't hold me up!
    (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
    Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
