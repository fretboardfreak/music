::

    To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
    To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines

    We toss and turn but don't sleep
    Each breath we take makes us thieves
    Like causes without rebels
    Just talk but promise nothing else

    We crawl on our knees for you
    Under a sky no longer blue
    We sweat all day long for you

    But we sow the seeds to see us through
    'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
    We wait to reap what we are due

    To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
    And the blare of a siren's combing the streets
    Chased down like dogs we run from
    Your grasp until the sun comes up

    We crawl on our knees for you
    Under a sky no longer blue
    We sweat all day long for you

    But we sow the seeds to see us through
    'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
    Look now at what they've done to you

    White needles buried in the red
    The engine roars and then it gives
    But never dies 'cause we don't live, we just survive
    On the scraps that you throw away

    I won't crawl on my knees for you
    I won't believe the lies that hide the truth
    I won't sweat one more drop for you

    'Cause we are the rust upon your gears
    We are the insect in your ears
    We crawl, we crawl
    We crawl all over you!

    We sow the seeds to see us through
    Our days are precious and so few
    We all reap what we are due

    Under this sky no longer blue
    We bring a dawn long overdue
    We crawl, we crawl
    We crawl all over you!
