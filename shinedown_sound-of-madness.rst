    Yeah, I get it, you're an outcast
    Always under attack, always coming in last
    Bringing up the past, no one owes you anything
    I think you need a shotgun blast, a kick in the ass
    So paranoid, watch your back

    Oh my, here we go

    Another lose cannon gone bi-polar
    Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
    Quicksand's got no sense of humor
    I'm still laughing like hell

    You think that by crying to me
    Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe
    You've been infected by a social disease
    Well, then take your medicine

    {Chorus}
    I created the sound of madness, wrote the book on pain
    Somehow I'm still here to explain
    That the darkest hour never comes in the night
    You can sleep with a gun
    When you gonna wake up and fight for yourself?

    I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
    If there's an afterlife then it'll set you free
    But I'm not gonna part the seas
    You're a self-fulfilling prophecy

    You think that by crying to me
    Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe
    You've been infected by a social disease
    Well, then take your medicine

    {Chorus x3}

    When you gonna wake up and fight for yourself? {x3}
