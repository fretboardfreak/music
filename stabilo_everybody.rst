    Doesn't anybody know how to walk anymore?
    Doesn't anybody know what a radio's for?
    Doesn't anybody wear their hair down low?
    Doesn't anybody know... doesn't anybody know

    Doesn't anybody hate it when the streetlight turns red?
    Doesn't anybody want 5 more minutes in bed?
    Doesn't anybody, doesn't anybody have a letter to send?
    Doesn't anybody wish they had just one more friend?

        Cause everybody wants and everybody needs,
        everybody asks for one more piece,
        everybody wants to hear someone say please

        Cause everybody takes and everybody steals
        everybody cries when something feels
        everybody's looking for teh drug that heals

    Doesn't anybody want to take another shot at me?
    Go ahead the gun is loaded and the bullets are for free.
    Doesn't anybody spray perfume to cover up a smell?
    Doesn't anybody know when I'm gonna get some... Ya Heh

        Cause everybody wants and everybody needs
        everybody begs for self-esteem
        why don't you get your mind out of the past

        everybody takes and everybody steals
        everybody's been kicked by other heels
        please raise your hands up in the air

    In the air, in the air.
    Why don't you raise your hands up in the air.
    Why don't you raise your, raise your, raise your hands in the air
    Why don't you raise your hands up in the air

        Cause everybody wants

    {repeat verse 1}

        Cause everybody wants
