    { Verse: A  C#m  D  A }
    I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
    I just need some place where I can lay my head
    Hey Mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed
    he just grinned shook my hand, no, was all he said

        { Chorus }
        { A  A/G#  D }
        Take a load off, Fanny
        take a load for free
        Take a load off, Fanny
        { D  A }
        Andd... [and] you put the load right on me

    { A  A/G#  | F#m7  E  | D  |  :| }

    { Verse: A  C#m  D  A }
    I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
    when I saw carmen and the devil walkin side by side
    I said, hey carmen, come on, lets go downtown
    she said, I got to go, but my friend can stick around

        { Chorus }

    { Verse: A  C#m  D  A }
    Go down, miss moses, there's nothing you can say.
    It's just old luke and luke's waiting on the judgement day
    well luke my friend, what about young anna lee
    he said, do me a favor son, won't you stay and keep anna lee company

        { Chorus }

    { Verse: A  C#m  D  A }
    crazy chester, followed me and he caught me in the fog
    he said, I will fix your rack, if you'll take jack my dog
    I said, wait a minute chester, you know I'm a peaceful man
    He said, that's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can

        { Chorus }

    { Verse: A  C#m  D  A }
    get your canonball now, to tkaee me down the line
    my bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time
    to get back to miss Fanny, You know she's the only one
    Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

        { Chorus }
