Scales
======

Scales are patterns of musical notes with prescribed intervals that repeat in
octaves. Scale theory is a formal way of describing the intervals between
musical notes.  There are a couple different notations for scales.  A very
common notation is numerical notation; in numerical notation roman numerals
represent each tone in the scale.  By varying how the roman numerals are written
or adding a few special symbols you can describe almost every possible scale. ::

    Harmonic Minor
    i ii* III iv v #VI VII i

The other notation I will use is based on the intervals between the notes that
make up the scale.  Every note is separated from each other note by one of a
half (H), a whole (W), a whole and a half (WH), etc.  One half step is the
interval between adjacent white keys on a piano or between adjacent frets on a
guitar. ::

    Harmonic Minor
    W H W W W H W

Western music is based off of a few base scales.  The difference between scales
is referred to as their `tonality <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality>`_.
The first tonality is called Major; all other tonalities are defined by how they
differ from the Major scale.

- Major::

    I ii iii IV V vi vii* I
     W  W   H  W W  W    H

- Minor::

    i ii* III iv v VI VII i
     W   H   W  W H  W   W

- Augmented
- Diminished
